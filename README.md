# Coding and Development Standards Framework

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding and development standards framework for the development of software applications, infrastructure As Code, Automation Scripts and CI/CD Pipelines. The framework is based on industry best practices and standards and is intended to be used as a guide for developers and DevOps engineers to ensure that the code and infrastructure developed is of high quality, maintainable, scalable, secure and efficient.

## Coding Standards

The coding standards are based on the following principles:

1. **Consistency**: The code should be consistent in terms of formatting, naming conventions, and coding style.

2. **Readability**: The code should be easy to read and understand.
3. **Maintainability**: The code should be easy to maintain and update.
4. **Scalability**: The code should be scalable and able to handle increasing loads.
5. **Security**: The code should be secure and follow best practices for security.  
6. **Efficiency**: The code should be efficient in terms of performance and resource usage.
7. **Documentation**: The code should be well-documented with comments and documentation files.
8. **Testing**: The code should be tested thoroughly with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
9. **Version Control**: The code should be version-controlled using a version control system like Git.
10. **Code Reviews**: The code should be reviewed by peers to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
11. **Continuous Integration**: The code should be integrated and tested automatically using a CI/CD pipeline.
12. **Deployment**: The code should be deployed automatically using a CI/CD pipeline.
13. **Monitoring**: The code should be monitored in production to ensure performance, availability, and security.
14. **Feedback**: Feedback should be collected from users and stakeholders to improve the code and the development process.
15. **Continuous Improvement**: The code and the development process should be continuously improved based on feedback and lessons learned.
16. **Compliance**: The code should comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
17. **Best Practices**: The code should follow industry best practices and standards.

## Development Standards

The development standards are based on the following principles:

1. **Agile Development**: The development process should be agile and iterative.
2. **DevOps**: Development and operations should be integrated to ensure smooth and efficient delivery.
3. **Automation**: Development tasks should be automated as much as possible.
4. **Collaboration**: Developers, operations, and other stakeholders should collaborate closely.
5. **Feedback**: Feedback should be collected from users and stakeholders to improve the development process.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: The development process should be continuously improved based on feedback and lessons learned.
7. **Compliance**: The development process should comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
8. **Best Practices**: The development process should follow industry best practices and standards.
9. **Documentation**: The development process should be well-documented with process documents, guidelines, and templates.
10. **Training**: Developers and operations should be trained on the development process and tools.
11. **Tools**: The development process should use the right tools for the job.
12. **Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) should be defined and monitored to measure the effectiveness of the development process.
13. **Risk Management**: Risks should be identified, assessed, and managed throughout the development process.
14. **Security**: Security should be built into the development process from the start.
15. **Quality Assurance**: Quality should be ensured throughout the development process with code reviews, testing, and other quality assurance measures.
16. **Deployment**: Deployment should be automated and repeatable.
