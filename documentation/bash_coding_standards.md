# Bash Scripting Standards

## Naming Standards

### Variable Naming

- **Use snake_case** for variable names.
  - Example: `max_retries`, `user_name`
- **Avoid single-letter variable names** unless used in loops or temporary contexts.
- **Use descriptive names** to make the script self-documenting.

### Function Naming

- **Use snake_case** for function names.
  - Example: `calculate_total`, `get_user_input`
- **Include a brief description** of the function’s purpose if it’s not immediately obvious.

### Class Naming

- **Use snake_case** for class names if applicable.
  - **Note**: Bash does not have native support for classes like object-oriented languages, but if using classes via external tools or frameworks, follow this convention.
  - Example: `user_model`, `order_processor`

### File Naming

- **Use snake_case** for script filenames.
  - Example: `deploy_script.sh`, `cleanup_temp_files.sh`
- **Include a descriptive name** and, if applicable, the action or purpose of the script.

### Folder Naming

- **Use snake_case** for folder names.
  - Example: `scripts`, `utils_scripts`

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Use `#!/bin/bash`** at the top of your script to specify the Bash interpreter.
- **Use consistent indentation** (2 or 4 spaces, not tabs).
- **Write clear comments** explaining the purpose of sections and complex logic.
- **Use `set -e`** to make the script exit on errors to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Include error handling** and validation for inputs.
- **Use double quotes** around variable references to avoid word splitting issues.
  - Example: `echo "$variable"`

### Control Structures

- **Use `[[ ]]` for conditional expressions** instead of `[ ]` for better functionality and readability.
  - Example: `if [[ $value -gt 10 ]]; then ...`
- **Use `case` statements** for multi-condition checks instead of multiple `if` statements where appropriate.

### Functions

- **Define functions using snake_case**.
- **Functions should be defined at the top** of your script or in a dedicated section.

## Code Review Standards

### Process

- **Submit pull requests** or merge requests for code changes.
- **Ensure all changes are reviewed** by at least one other team member before merging.

### Reviewer Responsibilities

- **Check for adherence** to naming and coding standards.
- **Verify script functionality** and error handling.
- **Provide feedback** and suggest improvements where applicable.

### Developer Responsibilities

- **Ensure scripts are tested** thoroughly before requesting a review.
- **Address feedback** and make necessary revisions in a timely manner.

## Additional Notes

- **Include any additional information** or project-specific guidelines here.
